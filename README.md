🧠 Objectives
Explore and clean the Netflix dataset

Understand the distribution of content by:

Type (Movie/TV Show)

Country

Genre

Release Year

Identify trends in content release over time

Visualize insights using various Python libraries

📦 Libraries Used
Pandas – for data manipulation

NumPy – for numerical operations

Matplotlib – for basic visualizations

Seaborn – for advanced statistical plots

Missingno – for visualizing missing data

Plotly – for interactive visualizations

WordCloud – for generating word clouds

Datetime – for time-based filtering

📌 Key Insights
The majority of content on Netflix is movies.

The United States has the highest number of Netflix titles.

The number of titles added each year shows a significant rise around 2018–2019.

Some genres like Documentaries, Dramas, and Comedies dominate Netflix's library.

Interactive plots help identify country-specific content trends.

🖼️ Sample Visuals
The notebook contains the following visualizations:

Count plots for Movies vs TV Shows

Yearly trends of content addition

Country-wise distribution of titles

Word clouds of titles and cast

Interactive bar charts using Plotly

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
Converted date fields to datetime format

Checked and visualized missing values

Removed or filled null values as needed

Extracted useful columns (year, country, etc.) for better insights
